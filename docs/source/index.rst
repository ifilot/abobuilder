ABO Builder
===========

**ABO Builder** is a Python package for generating ``.abo`` files used by
`Managlyph <https://ifilot.github.io/managlyph/>`__ to create stereoscopic 3D
visualizations, especially red/cyan anaglyph renderings of molecular and
structural models.

Purpose
-------

The package simplifies the process of converting scientific data from
electronic structure or molecular calculations into fully defined 3D scene
descriptions. These scenes include both geometry and visual styling, allowing
users to produce ready-to-view stereoscopic renderings without manually
constructing scene files.

Core Capabilities
-----------------

* Build ``.abo`` scene packages from computational chemistry or physics data
* Include atomic positions, element information, and orbital data
* Define visual properties such as color, transparency, and styling
* Export structured files that can be opened directly in Managlyph

Conceptually, ABO Builder acts as a scene construction tool that transforms
scientific results into visually rich, depth-enabled 3D environments.
